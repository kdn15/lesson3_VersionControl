            <p class="lead">Version control records all changes to a file and keeps different versions of the file and makes sure that the files are organized. Version control is helpful to use because it keeps different versions of the same file incase you need to change something from a previous version. Also version control is useful in a group environment incase of people editing and changing the same file at the same time there will be different versions as well. Version control keeps notes of who changed the files, when they were changed, what about them is new or different, an being about to combine different versions of a file into one.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repository is a remote server that is shared among team members in a group. People are able to send their version of a file or receive a different version of the same file from the remote repository. For example, if I were to be working on a project in a group I would most likely have a different version than anyone else if I am working and changing the file. Then for me to share my version of the altered file I would push my version of the file to the remote repository for everyone else in the group to be able to pull the file. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local repository is on an individual userâ€™s local device. There are two ways that a user can create a local repository. One way is create a brand new repository or you can pull a file off the remote repository into your local repository. For example, if I was creating a file or working on a file on my local machine and I wanted to share it with other members in my group, I would just need to push the file onto the remote repository, so that the other members can pull my file from it and have my version of the file on there local repository. </p>
